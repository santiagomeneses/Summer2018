# Summer2018
This repository is intended for storing data collected during the summer of 2018 (June - August). Due to data security reasons the name of the species is intentionally left out. 
Look for the Data glossary file to understand variable/column names, data file names, and R objects. 
Remember to avoid commenting your code with sensitive details that could be used by other people that happen to acces this repo.
Changes should be committed  unless the files contain sensitive information.
Sensitive information: any information that specifies or gives away the study system and or species name. Files that explain the processes and connection among the data files, R code and the questions tested are not to be committed pushed to this public repo.
